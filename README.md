# Calculates-Sets-Using-Python
Given, in a txt file, a number of operations, the kind of operation -that can be U (union), I (intersection), D (difference) and C (cartesian product)- 
writes in the console the results of the operations 

the first number in the txt file is optional and represents the total of operations that will be realized
the code only will work if the sets and the operators follow the following pattern:

operator (U, I, D, C)
set one (element1,element2,element3,element4...)
set two (element1,element2,element3,element4...)
operator...

there is an example for each operator in the txt file
